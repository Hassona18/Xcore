Steps to Create a Context Diagram:
1. Identify the System Boundary:

    Define the boundaries of the system. What constitutes the system, and what exists outside of it?

2. Identify External Entities:

    Determine the external entities that interact with the system. These could be users, other systems, databases, or any external element that communicates with the system.

3. Identify Interactions:

    List the high-level interactions between the system and its external entities. These interactions could be inputs, outputs, or data exchanges.

4. Diagram Creation:

    Use a tool like Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, draw.io, or any diagramming software capable of creating context diagrams.
    Represent the system as a central circle or box.
    Surround the system with the identified external entities (represented as squares or labeled ovals).
    Draw arrows to show the flow of data or interactions between the system and external entities.

Example of a Context Diagram for a System:

Let's assume the system is an e-commerce website:

    System Boundary: The e-commerce website (Xcore) as the system.

    External Entities:
        Users/Customer
        Administrator
        Payment Gateway
        Product Database
        Shipping Service

    Interactions:
        Users interact by browsing products, adding items to the cart, and making purchases.
        Administrators manage products, orders, and user accounts.
        Payment Gateway processes payment transactions.
        Product Database stores information about available products.
        Shipping Service handles the delivery of purchased items.

    Diagram Representation:
        The e-commerce website represented at the center.
        External entities (Users, Administrator, Payment Gateway, Product Database, Shipping Service) placed around the system.
        Arrows showing the interactions between the system and external entities.
